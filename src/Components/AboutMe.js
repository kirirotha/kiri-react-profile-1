                    I am an aspiring full stack software engineer who also has a master's degree in geosciences. I was previously employed as a geophysicist and I am now in the process of making a career change to software development in the tech industry.<br/><br/>

                    I enjoy working on difficult projects and flexing my problem-solving skills. I am a hard-worker who learns quickly and can adapt to different environments easily. I love being creative with my work and would like to put my efforts towards building inspiring concepts one day.<br/><br/>

                    In my spare time, you can find me out rock climbing, mountain biking, hiking, camping or travelling with my wife and kids.
